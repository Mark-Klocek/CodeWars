// A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

// Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.


//P We are given a string, and we are to determine if it is a pangram

//R: We are returning a boolean to see if the string is a pangram or not

//E:    'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' => true,
//      'this is a string' => false
