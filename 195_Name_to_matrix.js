// Given a name, turn that name into a perfect square matrix (nested array with the amount of arrays equivalent to the length of each array).

// You will need to add periods (.) to the end of the name if necessary, to turn it into a matrix.

// If the name has a length of 0, return "name must be at least one letter"
// Examples

// "Bill" ==> [ ["B", "i"],
//              ["l", "l"] ]

// "Frank" ==> [ ["F", "r", "a"],
//               ["n", "k", "."],
//               [".", ".", "."] ]

//Params: We are given a string that is a name, will it ever be empty? will it always be a string? Do we ever have to convert it>

//Return: we are to turn that string into a perfect matrix of arrays. If the matrix is larger than the letters of hte name, we are to replace each element in the matrix of arrays with a "."

//Example: "Greg" => [[G,r],[e,g]]
