// You're a programmer in a SEO company. The SEO specialist of your company gets the list of all project keywords everyday, then he looks for the longest keys to analyze them.

// You will get the list with keywords and must write a simple function that returns the biggest search keywords and sorts them in lexicographical order.

// For instance you might get:

// 'key1', 'key2', 'key3', 'key n', 'bigkey2', 'bigkey1'

// And your function should return:

// "'bigkey1', 'bigkey2'"


//P: we are given a function that has several arguments pased into it

//R: we are returning the longest argument, and if there are multiple with the same length, they want the array returned alphabeticaly

//E: ['one','two','three','seven'] => ['seven','three']

function theBiggestSearchKeys() {
